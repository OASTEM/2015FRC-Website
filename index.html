		Welcome to this (work in progress) website! We are FRC Team 4079, which stems off of the Oxford Academy student body. Oxford is a is a college preparatory high school located in Cypress, California and is most commonly known for being the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/california/districts/anaheim-union-high/oxford-academy-1748" target="_blank">top high school in the state.</a> The FRC team comes not from a class, but rather an after-school club known as STEM (referred to as OA STEM off campus). OA STEM offers more than robotics (Engineering) team. We offer the opportunities to compete in other science, technology, engineering, and mathematic competitions. If you are interested in learning more about OA STEM's image, head over to the <a href="/oastem">OA STEM</a> tab. To learn more about our our FRC team specifically, take it upon yourself to explore this website!
